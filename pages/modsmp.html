            <h1 class="title">Modded SMP</h1>
            <p>This section is a work in progress and may never be finished, but it's not like there would be a lot of useful information. You're better off 
                searching for YouTube videos on this topic.</p>
            <p>I planned to talk about my experience on Modded SMPs on this page, especially since I played solo when most people were playing in teams and 
                some were even x-raying or using hacks. For most people, it would be a lot smarter to form a group of skilled players whom you can trust, but 
                if you're anything like how I was in middle school, you either want to be the best on the server or have way too much time on your hands 
                <span class=comment>(which would probably be better spent on something more productive than playing a block game)</span>.</p>
            <p>This was supposed to be my third article, but I figured I would write more about <a href=nyctocosm.html>The Nyctocosm</a> instead. Here's a 
                <a href="nyctocosm.html#article3">link</a> to the article about more advanced concepts like Artifacts and Hypertraces.</p>

            <p class="comment">If you're curious, I've played on multiple friend group servers with over 300 mods, including Ice and Fire, Upgraded Netherite, 
                Epic Fight Mod, and Da Vinci's Vessels. I've made a lot of progress in each mod and might post some screenshots here.</p>
