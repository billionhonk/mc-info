            <h1 class="title">Modded SMP</h1>
            <p>This section is a work in progress and may never be finished, but it's not like there would be a lot of useful information. 
                You're better off searching for YouTube videos on this topic.</p>
            <p>Minecraft SMP (Survival Multiplayer) servers are a popular playstyle where users play to survive together on a single world.
                Mods are custom game additions that can be downloaded online and added to servers. To play on modded servers, the user must 
                download all of the mods used on the server and add them to their client via the files system.</p>
            <p>I planned to talk about my experience on Modded SMPs on this page, especially since I played solo when most people were 
                playing in teams and some were even x-raying or using hacks. For most people, it would be a lot smarter to form a group of 
                skilled players whom you can trust, but if you're anything like how I was in middle school, you either want to be the best 
                on the server or have way too much time on your hands <span class=comment>(which would probably be better spent on something 
                more productive than playing a block game)</span>.</p>
            <p>This was supposed to be my third article, but I figured I would write more about <a href=nyctocosm.html>The Nyctocosm</a> 
                instead. Here's a <a href=nyctocosm.html#article3>link</a> to the article about more advanced concepts like Artifacts and 
                Hypertraces.</p>

            <p class="comment">If you're curious, I've played on multiple friend group servers with over 300 mods, some including Ice and Fire, 
                Upgraded Netherite, Epic Fight Mod, and Da Vinci's Vessels. In addition to datapacks like The Nyctocosm, I've played with Bending from Avatar: The Last Airbender. I've made a lot of progress in each pack and might post some 
                screenshots here.</p>
