                <p><a target=_blank href=https://www.flubberschnub.com/releases/the-nyctocosm>The Nyctocosm</a> is a 
                    <a target=_blank href=https://minecraft.wiki/w/Tutorial:Installing_a_data_pack>datapack</a> that expands the Deep Dark 
                    by allowing the Ancient City portal to be activated, leading to a new dimension with custom biomes, weapons, and bosses. 
                    A new feature added in this datapack is the ability to cast 
                    <a target=_blank href=https://nyctocosm.miraheze.org/wiki/Spell_Directory>spells</a>, which require various ingredients 
                    and perform different tasks.</p>
                <p>The <a target=_blank href=https://nyctocosm.miraheze.org/wiki/Main_Page>Nyctopedia</a> is a great reference for the 
                    datapack's features, but this page will condense the concept of spells into a single article. The article may also serve 
                    as a <a target=_blank href=https://nyctocosm.miraheze.org/wiki/Quick_Start_Guide>quick-start guide</a> for new players 
                    looking to start their journey into the datapack.</p>

            <h1 class="title">Spells 101</h1>

            <h2>1. Preparation</h2>
            <article>
                <p>The <a target=_blank href="https://nyctocosm.miraheze.org/wiki/Seelic_Scythe">Seelic Scythe</a> is the figurative gateway 
                    into the Nyctocosm world. Crafting it requires the player to enter an 
                    <a target=_blank href=https://minecraft.wiki/w/Ancient_City>Ancient City</a> found in the 
                    <a target=_blank href=https://minecraft.wiki/w/Deep_Dark>Deep Dark</a>, which is commonly located 
                    under snowy mountains. Its recipe requires 3 <a href=https://minecraft.wiki/w/Echo_Shard>Echo Shards</a> 
                    (found occasionally in Ancient City chests) and 2 Sticks as shown:</p>
                <img width=auto height=150 src="https://static.wikitide.net/nyctocosmwiki/0/05/Scythe2.png">
                <p>Like all weapons in the datapack, the Seelic Scythe cannot be enchanted, but is unbreakable and comes with special 
                    abilities. One of them is a right-click ability that instantly teleports the player 6 blocks forward and damages entities 
                    in its trail. However, this deals some damage to the player as well.</p>
                <p>The scythe also harvests the soul of any mob it kills, which lingers for a few seconds and can be collected by standing 
                    close to the soul particles with an empty bottle to obtain a 
                    <a target=_blank href=https://nyctocosm.miraheze.org/wiki/Soul_Bottle>Soul Bottle</a>, which is stackable. This item is 
                    used in one method of casting spells, and for activating the 
                    <a href=https://nyctocosm.miraheze.org/wiki/Dais_of_Inculcation>Dias of Incultation</a> for the second.</p>
                <br><br>
                <p>This second method requires a bit more resources (primarily a Beacon or Nether Star from a 
                    <a target=_blank href=https://minecraft.wiki/w/Wither>Wither</a>) but is more useful overall. The 
                    <a target=_blank href=https://nyctocosm.miraheze.org/wiki/Planar_Coil>Planar Coil</a> also stores souls when held in the 
                    offhand slot and is acquired with 20 <a href=https://nyctocosm.miraheze.org/wiki/Seelic_Essence>Seelic Essence</a> 
                    (which costs 20 Soul Sand and 5 Blaze Rods) and 4 Golden Ingots.</p>
                <p>These materials can be traded in the Dias of Incultation (which is really just an invisible custom villager). Building it 
                    requires 4 Quartz Blocks, 4 Quartz Stairs, 4 
                    <a target=_blank href=https://minecraft.wiki/w/Cut_Copper_Slab>Waxed Cut Copper Slabs</a>, 1 
                    <a target=_blank href=https://minecraft.wiki/w/Beacon#Crafting>Beacon</a>, 1 
                    <a target=_blank href=https://minecraft.wiki/w/Anvil#Crafting>Anvil</a>, and a 
                    <a href=#candle-ring>Lit Candle Ring</a> as seen below. To activate the Dias of Incultation, right-click just above the 
                    anvil with a Soul Bottle.</p>

                <p>After obtaining the Planar Coil, hold it in the offhand to accumulate souls harvested from the Seelic Scythe. There is no 
                    limit to the amount of souls that can be collected.</p>

            <h2>2. Spell Planes</h2>
            <article>
                <p id="candle-ring">Spells require two ingredients: A 
                    <a target=_blank href=https://nyctocosm.miraheze.org/wiki/Spell_Plane>Spell Plane</a> 
                    and the core spell material. The first method of casting spells requires 25 lit candles arranged in a 7x7 circle like so:
                </p>
                <figure>
                    <img width=auto height=150 src="../assets/candle-ring.png">
                    <figcaption>
                        <p class="comment">Building schematic for a Lit Candle Ring.<br>
                        Candles can be lit with flint and steel or a flaming arrow.<br>
                        Oh, you need the <a target=_blank href=https://minecraft.wiki/w/Candle#Crafting>recipe</a> for a candle? Here it 
                        is.</p>
                    </figcaption>
                </figure>
                <p>The player must right-click a Soul Bottle while inside the circle for the Spell Plane to appear. Note: the soul will be 
                    consumed on use, and the Spell Plane will disappear if the player leaves the circle.</p>
                <br><br>
                <p>The second spellcasting method involves the 
                    <a target=_blank href=https://nyctocosm.miraheze.org/wiki/Planar_Coil>Planar Coil</a>. Holding it in the offhand and 
                    right-clicking with an empty hand while sneaking consumes a soul and creates a Spell Plane at the player's feet. Once 
                    again, leaving the circle will cause the plane to disappear.</p>
            </article>

            <br><br>

            <h2>3. Casting Spells</h2>
            <article>
                <p>To cast a spell, simply drop the corresponding material while in the Spell Plane. The most important spells are 
                    <a target=_blank href=https://nyctocosm.miraheze.org/wiki/Spell_Directory#Resonance>Resonance</a> (Echo Shard), which 
                    activates the Ancient City portal when aimed at it, 
                    <a target=_blank href=https://nyctocosm.miraheze.org/wiki/Spell_Directory#Luminescence>Luminescence</a> (Glowstone), 
                    which grants immunity to the Blindness effect applied when in the Nyctocosm in low light levels, and 
                    <a target=_blank href=https://nyctocosm.miraheze.org/wiki/Spell_Directory#Evanescence>Evanescence</a> (Eye of Ender), 
                    which allows the player to teleport to their spawn point and escape the dimension.</p>
                <p>A complete list of spells, their materials, and their effects are shown in the table below.</p>
                <p class="comment">Note: These numbers come from the wiki and have not been tested. Some, like duration, may not be accurate 
                    in-game (actual times are ~10% of the displayed time in seconds).</p>

        <section>
            <p>You thought we were done with spells, huh? That's only half of what The Nyctocosm has to offer in terms of 
                spells. The next section will cover much more advanced topics, but these will require extensive exploration of the new 
                dimension, so make sure you are familiar with spellcasting and the 3 core spells before you proceed.</p>
        <p>For the most part, the new dimension will be sparse and uneventful. Tents with lore books and dungeon-level loot are scattered in 
            the <a target=_blank href=https://nyctocosm.miraheze.org/wiki/Desert_of_Rime>Desert of Rime</a>. The 
            <a target=_blank href=https://nyctocosm.miraheze.org/wiki/Cimmerian_Gorge>Cimmerian Gorge</a> may contain a machine-like 
            structure with a similar chest. Beware of 
            <a target=_blank href=https://nyctocosm.miraheze.org/wiki/Nightmare_Apparition>Nightmare Apparitions</a>, which frequent the 
            <a target=_blank href=https://nyctocosm.miraheze.org/wiki/Night_Wastes>Night Wastes</a> and spawn when the player has the 
            Blindness effect, and <a target=_blank href=https://nyctocosm.miraheze.org/wiki/Death_Walker>Death Walkers</a>, which are often 
            found in the Cimmerian Gorge and sometimes appear behind the player.</p>
        <p>While the 3 custom bosses can be summoned here, the dimensional gloom may hide a rare and unassuming structure with treasure far 
            below the surface...</p>

            <h2>1. Crypts</h2>
            <article>
                <p>After entering the portal and exploring the various biomes of the Nyctocosm, a "Stonehenge-like structure" might be 
                    visible above ground in the Night Wastes.</p>
                <img width="auto" height="250" src="https://static.wikitide.net/nyctocosmwiki/f/ff/Crypt_Surface.png">
                <br><br>
                <p>Digging underground near the monument will lead to the 
                    <a target=_blank href=https://nyctocosm.miraheze.org/wiki/Crypt>Crypt</a>, a stronghold-like structure made of stone 
                    bricks.</p>
                <img src="https://static.wikitide.net/nyctocosmwiki/thumb/9/9e/Crypt1.png/600px-Crypt1.png" width="auto" height="250">
                <p>When entering the structure, say hi to Tony, the invulnerable cat who will appear and leave behind a lore book of its own. 
                    The Crypt consists of many rooms connected by winding tunnels, but chests with valuable loot can be found here. While 
                    the loot is very similar to Ancient City chests, with 
                    <a target=_blank href=https://minecraft.wiki/w/Enchanted_Golden_Apple>Enchanted Golden Apples</a>, diamond leggings, and 
                    <a target=_blank href=https://minecraft.wiki/w/Swift_Sneak>Swift Sneak</a>, each box has a random custom artifact, with 
                    the "dream center" chest containing 3 guaranteed, powerful artifacts: The 
                    <a target=_blank href=https://nyctocosm.miraheze.org/wiki/Artifact#Scroll_of_Dream/Nightmare/Resonance/Protection/etc.>Dream Scroll of Protection</a>, the

                    <a target=_blank href=https://nyctocosm.miraheze.org/wiki/Artifact#Tablet_of_Transposition>Tablet of Transposition.</a>
                    Most rely on a system explained in the next section.</p>
            </article>

            <br><br>

            <h2>2. Hypertraces</h2>
            <article>
                <p><a target=_blank href=https://nyctocosm.miraheze.org/wiki/Hypertrace>Hypertraces</a> make up a mysterious system stemming 
                    from a side effect of using spells. When dealing magic damage or casting a spell, the player has a 15% chance to create 
                    a Hypertrace, an orange floating halo that lingers for a few seconds before disappearing.</p>
                <img width=auto height=200 src="https://static.wikitide.net/nyctocosmwiki/0/02/Hypertrace.png">
                <p>To pick up a Hypertrace, right-click the halo or sneak + right-click to pick up all created Hypertraces. This adds to the 
                    player's "Hypertrace Charge", which cannot be seen but is used by some artifacts and has a maximum of 15 (starts at 5, 
                    but the method of upgrading this number is unknown).</p>
                <p>Standing close to (within 6 blocks) or destroying Hypertraces (left-click, or sneak + left-click for all) also activates 
                    some artifacts' abilities. More information is shown in the next section.</p>

            <h2>3. Artifacts</h2>
            <article>
                <p>Found in Crypt chests, these custom utility items empower spellcasting or grant special effects. A complete list of 
                    <a target=_blank href=https://nyctocosm.miraheze.org/wiki/Artifact>Artifacts</a> and their conditions is shown below.</p>
