            <article>
            <p><a target=_blank href=https://wiki.hypixel.net/Main_Page>Hypixel Skyblock</a> is the most popular minigame on the massively 
                successful Hypixel server (<code class="code">mc.hypixel.net</code>). It takes the simple Minecraft minigame of Skyblock, a 
                small floating island with minimal resources, and transforms it into an MMORPG with various skills, areas, monsters, NPCs, 
                gear, and events. Game-related information can be found on the 
                <a target=_blank href=https://wiki.hypixel.net/Main_Page>Hypixel Skyblock Wiki</a>.</p>
            <p><a target=_blank href=https://wiki.hypixel.net/Dungeon>Dungeons</a> is a combat-focused aspect of Skyblock, where up to 
                5 players select one of 5 classes and enter a randomly generated assortment of rooms with treasure, monsters, and bosses. 
                Both stats and monsters are buffed in Dungeons, but players can obtain materials to create and upgrade powerful equipment 
                that further increases Dungeons stats.</p>
            <p><a target=_blank href=https://wiki.hypixel.net/Catacombs>The Catacombs</a> is a Dungeon containing 7 floors, each with 
                stronger monsters and drops than the last. <a target=_blank href=https://wiki.hypixel.net/Wither_Armor>Wither Armor</a> 
                is obtained on the 7th floor and requires a Floor 7 completion to wear, but is used to create 4 variations, which are the 
                best armor in the game. Due to this, it is also one of the most expensive sets, often leading players to use lower-level or 
                budget armor sets. <a target=_blank href=https://wiki.hypixel.net/Shadow_Assassin_Armor>Shadow Assassin</a> armor is a 
                cheaper and comparable set for the Berserk class.</p>
            <p>As of February 23, 2025, the stats (left) and comparisons (right) for these sets are as shown in the table below.</p>
            <p class="comment">TL;DR: Maxor = spd + cd, Storm = int, Necron = str + cd, Goldor = hp + def, SA = str + cd + spd.<br>
                Goldor over Maxor sacrifices spd + cd for hp/def + int.<br>
                Maxor over SA sacrifices spd + str/cd for hp/def + int.<br>
                SA over Necron is worse in everything except spd. (-10 str -5 cd +8 spd)</p>
