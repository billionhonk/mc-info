                <p>Welcome to the website of a person who played way too much Minecraft in middle school. I wouldn't do this again, so please 
                    put your health and schoolwork first before playing for hours at a time.</p>
                <p>However, I may as well put those wasted hours to good use, so I've compiled some information in several niches of 
                    Minecraft that some people may find useful or at least somewhat interesting.</p>
